                            Located on the banks of the River Thames, London has been an important 
                            human settlement since it was founded by the Romans under the name of 
                            Londinium almost two millennia ago.
                            The city, the City of London, basically retains its medieval square 
                            mile perimeter. Since the 19th century the name "London" also refers 
                            to the entire metropolis developed around this nucleus. The bulk of 
                            this conurbation forms the London region and the Greater London 
                            administrative area, governed by the Mayor and the London Assembly.
